# Weather Doge
wow. Weather Doge is the full [dogeweather.com](http://dogeweather.com/) experience on Android!

[![Get it on Google Play!](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.versobit.weatherdoge)

## Features
 * Utilizes [OpenWeatherMap.org](http://openweathermap.org/) for weather data
 * All images are included with the app. The app only uses your data to communicate with the OWM API.
 * Polished, animated weather updates
 * Time and location-based cache. Weather Doge uses even less data and it loads super fast! By default, the cache expires in 10 minutes or when your location changes by 1.1km or more.
 * Backgrounds are properly rendered across the majority (all?) of Android phone screen sizes and densities.
 * Ability to force metric units in locales where metric is not the default
 * Option to set a constant OpenWeatherMap location, instead of relying on location services.
 * Open-source!

## TODO?
 * Create a Google Play Services-free build variant to eliminate dependancies on non-FOSS code.
 * [Comic Neue](http://comicneue.com/)
 * Implement CSPRNG
 * Option to force doge adjectives over top of weather info
 * Configurable drop shadows for all text
 * Ability to force doge adjectives to appear above weather info
 * Animate doge adjectives
 * Configure the temperatures at which certain doge adjectives appear
 * Cool doge loading gifs or something

## Building & Contributing
Import the project into Android Studio and you'll be up and running in no time. The build process relies on a shell script. Building will only work as-is for Mac and Linux systems until we create a Windows variant.

Got something to add? Best way to get your idea in to the app is forking, coding, and submitting a pull request!
