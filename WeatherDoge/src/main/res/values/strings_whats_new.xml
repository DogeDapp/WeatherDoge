    <string name="dialog_whats_new_text_1">Hello there fellow shibes! Here\'s a quick rundown of what\'s new in v1.2 of Weather Doge:</string>
    <string name="dialog_whats_new_text_2">• Android Lollipop support\n• Option for Yahoo Weather\n• A nifty widget!\n• Bug fixes\n• Better performance\n• Lots of under-the-hood stuff</string>
    <string name="dialog_whats_new_text_3">You can add the widget to your home screen just like any other! It\'ll look a little something like this:</string>
    <string name="dialog_whats_new_text_4">If you\'re having trouble finding the widget in your launcher, give your device a reboot. That usually fixes this odd bug.\n\nWe\'ve put in a lot of time and energy to make this widget work and look great on as many devices as possible. If the widget looks like this we have a fix for you:</string>
    <string name="dialog_whats_new_text_5">See how the sky background is all weird? Check the \"Background Fix\" option in the app to enable a shady workaround!\n\nIf you\'re still experiencing problems with the app or widget don\'t hesitate to send us an email (support@versobit.com) or talk to us on Twitter (@VersoBit).\n\nWe\'re proud to be the highest-rated, #1, and most professionally crafted Doge-themed weather app for Android! Thank you for making this possible.</string>

    <string name="dialog_whats_new_text_7">By the way, we found that awesome doge santa image by searching for \"doge santa\" on Google Images. We couldn\'t track down who created the photo and if we knew we would\'ve given them credit. Thank you, whoever you are!</string>
