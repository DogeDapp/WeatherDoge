    <string name="dialog_whats_new_text_3">The app should no longer crash on launch or when reloading location information. This issue occurred when Weather Doge could not find some shibes.\n\nTo ensure Weather Doge has the ability to find you make sure you set your device\'s location settings to \"High accuracy\" or \"Battery saving.\" The app will not receive location info from your device if it is set to \"Device only\" or \"Off.\"\n\nIf turning location services on is not an option for you, Weather Doge has a constant location setting.</string>
